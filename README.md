##  üìñ About

This is a collection of small and focused instances - each covering a single and well defined approach in the area of the java application development grouped by modules. Each module is supposed to provide a separate simple instance.
In this project each module presents a small simple instance of the unit test for the one java technology.
For instance, configuration files, db layer tests, service layer tests, controller layser tests and integration tests.
A strong focus of these is, of course, the different test approaches of the `spring-boot` RESTful API.

### Modules

This project includes the follows modules:

- [restful-test-instances-organisations](organisations/README.md) - this module is a simple `spring-boot` RESTful API which provides the create/read/update/delete operations for the manipulating `organization` entities;
- [restful-test-instances-db-local-test](db-local-test/README.md) - this module presents unit tests of the API model layer. For this tests is used the local database;
- [restful-test-instances-db-embedded-test](db-embedded-test/README.md) - this module presents unit tests of the API model layer. For this tests is used the embedded H2 database;
- [restful-test-instances-db-testcontainers-test](db-testcontainers-test/README.md) - this module presents unit tests of the API model layer. For this tests is used the postgreSQL  database on the docker container;
- [restful-test-instances-service-test](service-test/README.md) - this module presents unit tests of the API service layer;

## üéö Features

- The simple RESTful API which provides to create/read/update/delete operations. 
- A tests for the RESTful API part grouped by modules.

## üö¶ Getting Started

These instructions allow to get a copy of this project and run it on a local machine. 

### Prerequisites

Before using it, make sure that follows software are installed on the local machine:

- **[Oracle JDK 8+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)** -  java development kit;
- **[Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/)** - dependency management;
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)** - tool for defining and running multi-container `Docker` applications.

If any of the listed software is not installed, then it can be installed by instruction as described below.

1. #### Oracle JDK 8+

   - Install Oracle JDK 8+ according to instructions from an [official](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) instruction.

2. #### Maven 3+

   - Install Maven 3+ according to instructions from an [official](https://maven.apache.org/) source.

4. #### Docker Compose

   - Install PostgreSQL 9+ according to instructions from an [official](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) source.

### Installing

In order to install it is quite simple to clone or download this repository.

### Cloning

For the cloning this repository to a local machine, just use the follows link:

```http
https://github.com/ololx/restful-test-instances
```

### Using

To use it is necessary to:
1 - To deploy the additional software.
2 - To build the project.
3 - To launch the instances.

### Deploy the additional software

1 - To do the deployment of the additional software, execute docker compose in the root directory by the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

2 - Wait for all software deployment to complete.

### Building the project

To do the full build, execute maven goal `install` in the root directory by the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Building a single module

To do the full build, execute maven goal `install` in the module directory by the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Launching in command line

To do the full tests examples, execute maven goal `test` in the module directory by the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

### Launching in IDE

This is a multi-module project. Each model is supposed to provide a separate example. 
That's why when  you're working with an individual module, there's no need to import all of them (or build all of them) - you can simply import that particular module in either Eclipse, NetBeanse or IntelliJ IDEA and run each example  in IDE.

## üõ† Built With
